...while not by Neal Stephenson I can assure you that this tribute will make his inner scripter proud.  Well maybe not...

In my preparation for the Data Analysis olympics I have decided to improve my scripting skills for the Data Munging phase, aka the Starting blocks

I am evaluating the following languages/environments

1. R
2. Powershell
3. C# within the scriptcs environment

For exercises I'm starting with the following:

1. [CodeKata 4](http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/ "CodeKata 04: Data Munging")
2. [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/mw/index.php?title=Data_Munging  "Rosetta Code")

R | Powershell | C#
--- | --- | ---
link1 | LInk2 | link3
